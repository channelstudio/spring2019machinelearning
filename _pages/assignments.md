### The Midterm - due 4/8

What can it be?

* Critical - a protest piece, something intended to raise awareness, critical of tech etc
* A new interface for creativity - design tool 
* Something that sparks joy - a game, something goofy and fun
* Something that speaks to your personal practice


Using what we have covered so far (or more, if you're feeling ambitious), create a web application, physical device, or piece of writing. Please feel free to work in groups of no more than four people if you are making a web app or product concept. Essays cannot be undertaken as groups. This project may be combined with other classes but you must first discuss with me. 

Acceptable outputs from this project:
* A functioning web application
* Product concept (sketches and prototype)
* Essay (under 10 pages) - be sure to speak with me before selecting this option

Presenting the project: 

If there are no group projects then we will have 8 minutes per person to present, "pecha kucha" style. No matter which of the three project types you select, I will be expecting a fairly concrete and succinct presentation of about 5 minutes.

Metrics for grading:
* 25% - Originality of concept - Does the project demonstrate an original and novel concept?
* 25% - Fit and finish - Is the project "well put together"?
* 25% - Overall design - Do the various design elements come together to tell a coherent story?
* 25% - Theme - Does the project follow the prompt and have a consistent user experience?

**By Friday 3/29, please send me a one paragraph proposal for your midterm with any necessary sketches.**
