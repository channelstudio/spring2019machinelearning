## Web Development

* [My other class on web development](http://courses.channel.studio/fall2018webdesignbasics)

* [P5](http://p5js.org) - website for one of the primary Javascript libraries we will be using for this class

## Machine Learning
* [ml5](https://ml5js.org/) - this is the machine learning library we will be using, along with p5js

* [The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com/) - Dan Shiffman’s legendary and highly entertaining YouTube channel. This has everything from intro to p5 tutorials to neural network deep-dives.

* [distill.pub](https://distill.pub) - Interactive demos of many machine learning principles

* [3Blue1Brown](https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk) - 3Blue1Brown neural network series

## Advanced resources:
Given the wide range of abilities in this class, it will be difficult to move at a pace everyone agrees with. Given this, I openly welcome students to try and work outside of the materials presented in this class and research/implement emerging technologies independently. Below are some more advanced resources for this.

* [ml4a](https://ml4a.github.io/) is run by Gene Kogan and has a series of excellent and comprehensive guides, demos, classes, and code written primarily in python.

* [Machine Learning for Artists and Musicians](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/machine-learning-for-musicians-and-artists-v) Rebecca Fiebrink is the creator of Wekinator, a machine learning platform meant for real time performance

* [Fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/ ) is an excellent free MOOC started by Rachel Thomas and Jeremy Howard. They have several course - machine learning, deep learning, cutting edge deep learning, and linear algebra.

* [Andrew Ng’s popular Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) for those who want to learn more about the nuts and bolts of machine learning

* [Stanford CS231N](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) - Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition at Stanford

## Additional resources:
Links to interesting topics related to the class, but not necessary for coursework

* [Runway](https://runwayapp.ai/) - A new toolkit that aims to remove the need to code in creating machine learning creative work.
